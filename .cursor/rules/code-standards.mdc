# Code Standards

Follow these rules when writing code.

## TypeScript

-   **Prefer Inference:** Allow TypeScript to infer types whenever possible. Avoid explicit type annotations where inference is clear and sufficient.
    -   *Bad:* `const count: number = 0;`
    -   *Good:* `const count = 0;`

## Architecture & Code Structure

-   **Modular Components:** Break down UI into small, single-responsibility components.
-   **Separation of Concerns:**
    -   Separate logic, data fetching, and presentation.
    -   Organize files by feature or domain responsibility.
    -   Use directories to group related files (e.g., `components/Feature/` with `index.tsx`, `utils.ts`, `styles.css`).

## Best Practices

-   Ensure all new components have appropriate props interfaces (if props are needed and not inferred from usage in a way that provides type safety).
-   Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
