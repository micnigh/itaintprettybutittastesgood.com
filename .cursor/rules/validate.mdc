# Validation Rule

After completing a request that involves modifying code, ALWAYS run the validation command to ensure code quality.

## Command

Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm validate
```

## Behavior

1.  If the validation fails, fix the errors reported by the command.
2.  Do not mark the task as complete until validation passes.
