# Validation Rule

After completing a request that involves modifying code, ALWAYS run the validation command to ensure code quality.

## Command

Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm validate
```

## Behavior

1.  If the validation fails, fix the errors reported by the command.
2.  Do not mark the task as complete until validation passes.

## Test Types

The validation command runs all three types of tests:
- **Unit tests** (`.unit.test.ts`, `.unit.test.tsx`) - Test individual functions and utilities
- **Integration tests** (`.integration.test.ts`, `.integration.test.tsx`) - Test component interactions and integrations
- **E2E tests** (`.e2e.test.ts`) - Test full user workflows in the browser
