And takes all of 10 min to make!!\n* Saute garlic with the butter, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning\n* When the garlic is fragrant (about 2 min of cooking) add in the heavy cream\n* Set the whole thing on medium heat and stir constantly and watch for the cream to thicken\n* When there is a light simmer add in the parmesan cheese (fresh is better for taste and just the overall consistency) \n* And when everything is combined and the sauce has thickened it is ready to use\n",

We decided that it was bullcrap. So for our first thanksgiving in the new house I asked Laura what she wanted to do and she had a whole lot of ideas! One of those ideas was this lovely bread. It is so perfect not just for holidays but for every day. I hope that you love this as much as we do. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 3 cups flour, beast to use bread flour (make it pressed and slightly heaping cups)\n* 1 teaspoon salt (slightly heaping)\n* ½ teaspoon yeast (slightly under ½ teaspoon)\n* 1-2 teaspoons sugar\n* 1 ½ cups hot water (not boiling)\n### Preparation\n\n* Pin the bowl combine yeast, sugar, and hot water and allow to bloom\n* Add in flour and salt. Combine until dough is hydrated and fully incorporated, if the dough is too dry add a bit (small amounts) of hot water until dough is hydrated but not wet\n* Cover bowl with cling wrap and a towel and set on the counter until the dough has significantly risen (approx 6 hours to overnight)\n* Turn out risen dough on a well floured surface and knead to a smoother finish and shape dough into a ball (2-3 min) cut the top of the dough with a x shape to allow for ventilation \n* Place dough ball into a parchment lined bowl (can use the same bowl that the dough was originally resing in it just needs to be quickly cleaned and dried\n* Cover bowl with a towel\n* Heat oven to 450 and place dutch oven into heating over and allow to come to temp (leave it in there for 30 min)\n* Place parchment and dough in the the warmed dutch oven and with a lid on bake for 30 min allowing the dough to steam slightly and the top will become golden brown\n* Remove dough and parchment from the dutch oven and return the dough to the warm pot bake again without the lid allowing the whole bread to turn golden brown 5-6 min for lightly browned and 10-15 for a deeper brown\n* Set bread out for 2 hours before cutting\n"

This is the full recipe for making brioche as my Aunt Camille taught me. You don’t know her and that is ok but she is a brilliant chef and for all of her faults she has amazing taste and some recipes that are just to die for. This recipe can be used for cinnamon rolls, sticky rolls, sticky buns,or really anything you can think of. This is one of them. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1lb butter- melted\n* 4 cups whole milk (warm milk to reach temperatures between 105-110 degrees)\n* 2 tablespoons yeast\n* 2 tablespoons salt\n* 1 cup sugar\n* 6 eggs\n* 11 cups flour\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 375 degrees (this is an “until done” recipe)\n* Bloom sugar, milk, and yeast until it foams. This takes a few minutes and you can start to smell the yeast. \n* Melt the butter and let it cool (let it cool till it is just warm not boiling)\n* Once the butter is cool and the yeast is foamy add all of the other ingredients in except the last 4 cups of the flour and mix thoroughly\n* Add in the flour reserve small amounts at a time\n* Mix on a low speed with a bread hook for 20-30 min (I( like to make it closer to 20 thean 30 just my opinion)\n* Remove bowl from the mixer and allow the dough to double in size on the counter\n* Punch down the risen dough and shape into its desired shape (if you are making cinnamon rolls this is the time to flatten the dough and roll it out with all of the ingredients and then make the roll shape), allow it to rise again\n",

    "markdown": "### Summary\n\nNathan,\n\nThese are fun and easy cookies to capture the holiday spirit and can all be made in one bowl so that is a bonus! I started with these cookies for your first Christmas. I wanted you to have a tradition that wasn’t gift based to share with others as well as to capture the Christmas spirit. I had a lot of fun making these with you. You were strapped to my chest and I just got to dance and sing Christmas songs with you. You smiled the whole time. Please share them with all your loved ones and know that every moment of my life I have been the happiest just being with you and your father. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\nP.S.\n\nOk one more thing if you want to add other spices go for it! It would be so much fun for you to make these just a little more your own if you want. Over the years I will be doing the same thing but I am thinking Nutmeg and Cinnamon and Clove would bring in the warmth this holiday makes me feel. Just a thought!!\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 3 eggs\n* 2 cups sugar\n* ¾ cups softened butter (just leave it on the counter a day before)\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 2 ½ cups flour\n* 12oz fresh cranberries (you can use frozen too!)\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 350 degrees and set out your baking trays with a silicone baking sheet and your wire racks for cooling\n* With a mixer (you can use my stand mixer; either one will work for this) beat the eggs and sugar until slightly thickened and light in color (like 5-7 min, you can put it on the 2 setting and walk away and gather the rest of the ingredients while it is going). The egg and sugar mixture will almost double in size and should form a ribbon when you lift the beaters (remember when I showed you how to make a figure 8 by lifting the beaters with some of the batter on it and you should be able to still see the “ribbon” before it incorporates back with the rest of the mixture)\n* Add softened butter, vanilla, and salt to the egg/sugar mixture and mix well for 2 more min. This does not have to be extremely smooth by any means. There will still be small bits of butter that will not completely go away and that is a good thing.\n* Stir in flour until just combined (don’t over mix)\n* Stir in whole cranberries (they will piece a little with the mixer but that just makes it fun)\n* Scoop onto a silicone baking sheet and bake for 18 min. \n* When finished place on a wire rack for cooling (this will also help the cookies harden a little more so that they don’t break apart when you dive right in and eat them all)\n",

I thought a pie would be nice because the smell of a pie baking in the oven is too tasty to pass up. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 4 cups fresh cranberries or frozen\n* 1 orange (zest then juice) if you don’t want to juice it yourself then like a 1/2c oj\n* 1 ½ cups sugar\n* 1 tablespoon salt\n* 1 tablespoons flour\n* 1 packet gelatin (.25oz)\n* 1 store bought pie crust (1 top and one bottom, let's make this easy!)\n* 1 egg beaten to wash\n* 3 tablespoons sugar to top\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 325 degrees and \n* Place one pie crust in a 9”or 10” glass pie pan and set aside\n* Simmer on low cranberries, orange juice with or without the pulp, 1 ½ cups sugar, and salt on the stove top until the cranberries burst (if you use the frozen cranberries this will take a little longer but you still hear the “popping” sound when they burst and that is always fun)\n* Add flour and gelatin until the mixture thickens\n* Once thickened, pour the mixture into the pie pan and top with 1 teaspoon of the orange zest and then the second pie crust.\n* Make slits in the top of the pie crust so that it has some ventilation (if you want to be fancy you can cut designs in the top just use a cookie cutter to make it a little easier) and brush with the egg wash. When fully washed sprinkle on the 3 tablespoons of sugar (or add as much as you want at this point)\n* Bake in the over for 40-45 mins at 325 degrees \n",

I however don’t have all bad memories of our time together before I had to make the decision to remove her from our lives. One of the memories that I do have is about us making kitchen sink cookies together. She was a bit of a health nut and thought that these protein packed cookies could be a healthy snack. I however didn’t think that they would be that good so I was hesitant. These are so good that I had to redo my thinking on healthy snacks from then on. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients (dry* then wet**)\n\n* * 1 cup whole wheat flour\n* * ¼ cup soy flour\n* * 1 ⅓ cups rolled oats\n* * ¾ cups unsweetened flaked coconut\n* * ¼ cup milk powder (⅓ cup instant)\n* * ½ teaspoon salt\n* * 1 teaspoon cinnamon\n* * ½ teaspoon powdered ginger\n* * ⅔ cups raisins (currants)\n* * ⅔ cups chocolate chips\n* * ¼ cup chopped peanuts\n* * ⅓ cup sunflower seeds\n* ** ¼ cup oil or melted butter\n* ** ¼ cup molasses\n* ** ¼ cup honey\n* ** 2 eggs beaten\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 350 degrees\n* Mix all dry ingredients * in one bowl\n* Mix all wet ingredients ** in separate bowl\n* Combine the wet mixture into the dry mixture.

    "markdown": "### Summary\n\nNathan,\n\nSo for Christmas and Thanksgiving your Aunt Laura was always relegated to bringing rolls. She thinks that this is because we didn’t think that she could cook but it was really because she always brought the best rolls. She has started to make her own bread at home and it is taking center stage in our house. This roll recipe was to try and mimic the rolls that she used to bring over. They are a good staple to have for your future gathering needs. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 2 tablespoons shortening (softened butter)\n* 3 tablespoons white sugar\n* 1 cup hot water \n* 1 .25oz package of active dry yeast\n* 1 egg, beaten\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 2 ¼ cups flour\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven at 425 degrees\n* Grease 8 muffin cups and set aside\n* In a large bowl mix the shortening, sugar and hot water, allow to cool until luke warm (110 degrees) and mix in the yeast until dissolved and froths\n* Mix in all the rest of the ingredients \n* Allow the doubt to rise and double in size\n* Punch down the dough and separate into 8 equal parts\n* Put each part into the greased muffin tin and allow it to rise for a second time (double in size again)\n* Bake for 10min\n",

    "markdown": "### Summary\n\nNathan,\n\nI made up this recipe the year before you were born for my office Christmas potluck. I wanted to make something that was traditional, yule log, but with a twist. I couldn’t find anything online that I was looking for so I had to come up with a recipe that worked and could be all combined for the perfect recipe. So this recipe you will see will be in 5 parts. There are ingredients and preparation for each of the components and then at the very end a guide to create this special yule log recipe. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients (cake)\n\n* 6 large eggs , separated\n* 1 ⅓ cups cake flour\n* 1 ½ cups sugar, divided\n* ¼ teaspoon salt\n* ⅓ cup orange juice (fresh squeezed is good)\n* 3 teaspoons grated orange zest (fresh)\n* ¾ teaspoons cream of tartar\n* Put each part into the greased muffin tin and allow it to rise for a second time (double in size again)\n* Bake for 10min\n### Preparation (Cake)\n\n* Preheat oven at 325 degrees \n* Place egg whites in a large bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 min\n* Sift flour, ⅓ cup of sugar, and salt together twice; set aside\n* In another bowl beat egg yolks on high speed for 5 min or until thick and lemony colored\n* Gradually beat in ⅔ cups sugar, orange juice, and orange zest; beat for 3 min longer\n* Gradually add flour mixture and mix well\n* Add cream of tartar to egg whites (when at room temperature) and beat on medium speed until soft peaks form\n* Add remaining sugar and tablespoon at a time on high until stiff peaks form\n* Fold egg white mixture into batter\n* Gently spoon into a cookie sheet with a silicone liner ½inch thick\n* Cut though batter with a knife to remove air pockets\n* Bake on the lowest oven rack until the cake springs back when lightly touched and is  golden on top and toothpick can be inserted and comes out clean)\n* Immediately invert on a lightly floured linen cloth rag (roll into desired shape with the cloth rolled up into the cake) and allow to cool till warm\n### Ingredients (spiced cranberry sauce)\n\n* 12oz fresh or frozen cranberries\n* 1 ¾ cups sugar\n* ½ cup water\n* ½ teaspoon cinnamon\n* ½ teaspoon ground allspice\n* ⅛ teaspoon salt\n* ⅛ teaspoon ground ginger\n* ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves\n### Preparation (spiced cranberry sauce)\n\n* PIn a large saucepan combine all ingredients and bring to a boil\n* Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until the berries pop and the mixture is thickened, about 30 min\n* Cool and transfer to a covered container and refrigerate until chilled\n### Ingredients (mascarpone filling)\n\n* ½ cup heavy whipping cream; cold\n* ¼ cup powdered sugar\n* ½ cup + 1 tablespoon mascarpone at room temperature (drain for 10-15 min to remove any excess liquid for best results)\n* ½ teaspoon vanilla\n### Preparation (mascarpone filling)\n\n* In a bowl beat the whipping cream and sugar until stiff peaks form\n* Beat mascarpone and vanilla until smooth\n* Combine both mixtures and whip until smooth (don’t over whip!!)\n### Ingredients (italian meringue)\n\n* 1 cup sugar (7 ounces; 200g)\n* ½ cup water\n* 4 egg whites at room temperature (fresh is best)\n* ½ teaspoon cream of tartar or alternative of 1 lemon juiced \n### Preparation (italian meringue)\n\n* In a small saucepan combine sugar and water, Heat over hight heat, stirring only until it comes to a boil. Once it reaches a boil STOP STIRRING. \n* Cook until sugar syrup registers 240 degrees (115 degrees celsius) on an instant-read or candy thermometer. Brush down the sides of the pot as necessary with a pastry brush dipped in water (just to get the crystals of the walls of the pot)\n* Meanwhile,  combine egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix on medium speed until soft peaks form about 2 min\n* With the mixer running, carefully and slowly drizzle in how sugar syrup\n* Increase speed to high until hard peaks form\n* Transfer to piping bag with desired tip\n### Assembly\n\nWith the cake warm and rolled with the lightly floured linen gently unroll and allow it to keep its shape slightly. Spread mascarpone cream filling over inside of the cake roll (leave 1 inch on every edge free of filling. Drop spread spiced cranberry sauce over the mascarpone filling (does not need to be exact just drop and lightly spread). Once the filling is in the cake roll re roll the cake in the lightly floured linen cloth. Do not roll the cloth back up into the roll this time. Once it is rolled tight, place in the freezer for 2 hours. Take it out of the freezer and place it on an oven safe serving dish. Pipe italian meringue lengthwise on the log and add swirls to mimic tree branch stumps when still soft, drag a fork over the meringue to add bark texture. Place the whole thing in the oven and broil until a nice golden crust forms on the meringue. Watch it carefully or it will burn. Serve to loved ones!\n\n",
