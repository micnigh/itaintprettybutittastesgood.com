  "markdown": "### Summary\n\nNathan,\n\nThese cookies came to our family because I bought too much ground cardamom and I needed something to do with it all.Cardamom smells so so lovely and vibrant that I instantly thought that baking with it would be the best. I found this recipe online and the rest is history. I make some slight changes every time I bake them but this is the base recipe that is so good. Best with a “spot” of tea. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients \n\n* 1 Cup brown butter\n* ¾ Cup Sugar\n* 1 large egg yolk\n* 1 tablespoon vanilla\n* ½ teaspoon ground cardamom\n* 2 cups flour\n* 1 cup powdered sugar (use as coating at the end of the baking cycle)\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 350 degrees\n* Combine cooled brown butter and sugar until well mixed adding all ingredients at a time (excluding powdered sugar) until dough forms\n* Shape dough into 1” balls and place on cookie sheet 1” apart\n* Bake for 10-12 min until cookie puffs and start to turn light brown, cookies will have cracks in them\n* Immediately remove from cookie sheets and allow to cool for 1 min\n* Roll cookies in powdered sugar while warm and again when completely cooled\n",
