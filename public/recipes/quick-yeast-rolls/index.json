She thinks that this is because we didn’t think that she could cook but it was really because she always brought the best rolls. She has started to make her own bread at home and it is taking center stage in our house. This roll recipe was to try and mimic the rolls that she used to bring over. They are a good staple to have for your future gathering needs. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n* 2 tablespoons shortening (softened butter)\n* 3 tablespoons white sugar\n* 1 cup hot water \n* 1 .25oz package of active dry yeast\n* 1 egg, beaten\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 2 ¼ cups flour\n* Preheat oven at 425 degrees\n* Grease 8 muffin cups and set aside\n* In a large bowl mix the shortening, sugar and hot water, allow to cool until luke warm (110 degrees) and mix in the yeast until dissolved and froths\n* Mix in all the rest of the ingredients \n* Allow the doubt to rise and double in size\n* Punch down the dough and separate into 8 equal parts\n* Put each part into the greased muffin tin and allow it to rise for a second time (double in size again)\n* Bake for 10min\n",
