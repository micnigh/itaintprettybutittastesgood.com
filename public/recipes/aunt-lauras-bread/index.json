We decided that it was bullcrap. So for our first thanksgiving in the new house I asked Laura what she wanted to do and she had a whole lot of ideas! One of those ideas was this lovely bread. It is so perfect not just for holidays but for every day. I hope that you love this as much as we do. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 3 cups flour, beast to use bread flour (make it pressed and slightly heaping cups)\n* 1 teaspoon salt (slightly heaping)\n* ½ teaspoon yeast (slightly under ½ teaspoon)\n* 1-2 teaspoons sugar\n* 1 ½ cups hot water (not boiling)\n### Preparation\n\n* Pin the bowl combine yeast, sugar, and hot water and allow to bloom\n* Add in flour and salt. Combine until dough is hydrated and fully incorporated, if the dough is too dry add a bit (small amounts) of hot water until dough is hydrated but not wet\n* Cover bowl with cling wrap and a towel and set on the counter until the dough has significantly risen (approx 6 hours to overnight)\n* Turn out risen dough on a well floured surface and knead to a smoother finish and shape dough into a ball (2-3 min) cut the top of the dough with a x shape to allow for ventilation \n* Place dough ball into a parchment lined bowl (can use the same bowl that the dough was originally resing in it just needs to be quickly cleaned and dried\n* Cover bowl with a towel\n* Heat oven to 450 and place dutch oven into heating over and allow to come to temp (leave it in there for 30 min)\n* Place parchment and dough in the the warmed dutch oven and with a lid on bake for 30 min allowing the dough to steam slightly and the top will become golden brown\n* Remove dough and parchment from the dutch oven and return the dough to the warm pot bake again without the lid allowing the whole bread to turn golden brown 5-6 min for lightly browned and 10-15 for a deeper brown\n* Set bread out for 2 hours before cutting\n",
