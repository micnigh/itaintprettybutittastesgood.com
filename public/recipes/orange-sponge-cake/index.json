I found that it is a good versatile cake recipe and it is good to have for a nice spring tea party or a summer cake with sweetened whipped cream filling.I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients (cake)\n\n* 6 large eggs , separated\n* 1 ⅓ cups cake flour\n* 1 ½ cups sugar, divided\n* ¼ teaspoon salt\n* ⅓ cup orange juice (fresh squeezed is good)\n* 3 teaspoons grated orange zest (fresh)\n* ¾ teaspoons cream of tartar\n### Ingredients (optional glaze)\n\n* ⅓ cup butter, cubed\n* 2 cups confectioners sugar\n* 3 to 5 teaspoons water\n* 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract\n### Preparation (Cake)\n\n* Preheat oven at 325 degrees \n* Place egg whites in a large bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 min\n* Sift flour, ⅓ cup of sugar, and salt together twice; set aside\n* In another bowl beat egg yolks on high speed for 5 min or until thick and lemony colored\n* Gradually beat in ⅔ cups sugar, orange juice, and orange zest; beat for 3 min longer\n* Gradually add flour mixture and mix well\n* Add cream of tartar to egg whites (when at room temperature) and beat on medium speed until soft peaks form\n* Add remaining sugar and tablespoon at a time on high until stiff peaks form\n* Fold egg white mixture into batter\n* Gently spoon into an ungreased 10in tube pan (if making a cake roll use a cookie sheet with a  silicone liner and only cover ½ thick)\n* Cut though batter with a knife to remove air pockets\n* Bake on the lowest oven rack for 45-55 mins or until the cake springs back when lightly touched (for cake rolls bake until golden top and toothpick can be inserted and comes out clean)\n* Immediately invert pan and cool completely about 1 hour (for cake roll invert on a lightly floured linen cloth rag and allow to cool till warm)\n### Preparation (optional glaze)\n\n* Melt butter in small saucepan; remove from the heat\n* Add confectioners sugar, water, and vanilla\n* Stir until smooth pour over cake, allowing it to drizzle down sides \n"
