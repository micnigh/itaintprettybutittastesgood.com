Everyone who has had these either vegan or not have loved them and said that it is their favorite way to have chocolate chip cookies. I like to make a huge batch of these and scoop them out to freeze them so that when we just want a few we can go to the freezer and pull them out. These can also be eaten without baking at all! I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n* ½ cup coconut oil, softened not liquid\n* 1 cup brown sugar\n* ¼ cup milk (*almond milk)\n* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n* 2 cups flour\n* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1 teaspoon baking powder\n* ½ teaspoon salt\n* 1 cup chocolate chips (*vegan chocolate chips)\n* Preheat oven to 350 degrees and set a baking tray with a silicone mat aside\n* Mix coconut oil, brown sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in stand mixer\n* In a separate bowl mix the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt\n* Combine the flour mixture into the wet mixture slowly till crumbly\n* Add chocolate chips\n* This recipe will be crumbly and that is OK!\n* If you are freezing this recipe please please please scoop this recipe into balls and freeze prior to putting these into a bag or vacuum seal bag for later use.\n* If you are going to eat them right away bake at 350 degrees for 7-10 min\n* If you are going to make them from frozen bake at 350 degrees for 15-18 min\n",
