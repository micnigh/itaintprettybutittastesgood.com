Please be careful. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 cup sugar (7 ounces; 200g)\n* ½ cup water\n* 4 egg whites at room temperature (fresh is best)\n* ½ teaspoon cream of tartar or alternative of 1 lemon juiced \n### Preparation\n\n* In a small saucepan combine sugar and water, Heat over hight heat, stirring only until it comes to a boil. Once it reaches a boil STOP STIRRING. \n* Cook until sugar syrup registers 240 degrees (115 degrees celsius) on an instant-read or candy thermometer. Brush down the sides of the pot as necessary with a pastry brush dipped in water (just to get the crystals of the walls of the pot)\n* Meanwhile,  combine egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix on medium speed until soft peaks form about 2 min\n* With the mixer running, carefully and slowly drizzle in how sugar syrup\n* Increase speed to high until hard peaks form\n* Transfer to piping bag with desired tip\n",
