He likes to put in recipes that he wants to try as well and full vetted recipes that are the best. That is sort of what I am trying to do with these recipes. I want you to have all the good things in life and maybe a few of these will bring you joy when you remember baking and cooking with me. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients \n\n* 2 cups sugar\n* 2 cups flour\n* 1 teaspoon soda\n* 2 eggs\n* 1 cup oil\n* 3 large pears (peeled and sliced thin)\n* 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n* ¼ teaspoon salt\n* ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla\n* 1 teaspoon water\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 350 degrees\n* Combine eggs and toil till foamy then add vanilla and water and set aside\n* Mix dry ingredients in separate bowl\n* Combine wet and dry ingredients and fold in pears\n* Pour into 9x13 pan and bake for 1 hour\n* Frosting is not needed but it you want a little added sweetness mix up some powdered sugar glaze (powdered sugar and milk)\n"
