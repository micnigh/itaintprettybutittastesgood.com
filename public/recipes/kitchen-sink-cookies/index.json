  "markdown": "### Summary\n\nNathan,\n\nOk so as you know I do not have a good relationship with my own biological mother. I however don’t have all bad memories of our time together before I had to make the decision to remove her from our lives. One of the memories that I do have is about us making kitchen sink cookies together. She was a bit of a health nut and thought that these protein packed cookies could be a healthy snack. I however didn’t think that they would be that good so I was hesitant. These are so good that I had to redo my thinking on healthy snacks from then on. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients (dry* then wet**)\n\n* * 1 cup whole wheat flour\n* * ¼ cup soy flour\n* * 1 ⅓ cups rolled oats\n* * ¾ cups unsweetened flaked coconut\n* * ¼ cup milk powder (⅓ cup instant)\n* * ½ teaspoon salt\n* * 1 teaspoon cinnamon\n* * ½ teaspoon powdered ginger\n* * ⅔ cups raisins (currants)\n* * ⅔ cups chocolate chips\n* * ¼ cup chopped peanuts\n* * ⅓ cup sunflower seeds\n* ** ¼ cup oil or melted butter\n* ** ¼ cup molasses\n* ** ¼ cup honey\n* ** 2 eggs beaten\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 350 degrees\n* Mix all dry ingredients * in one bowl\n* Mix all wet ingredients ** in separate bowl\n* Combine the wet mixture into the dry mixture. If the dough is too dry add some milk or water until “drop cookie” consistency \n* Bake at 350 degrees for 10-12 min \n",
