This is the full recipe for making brioche as my Aunt Camille taught me. You don’t know her and that is ok but she is a brilliant chef and for all of her faults she has amazing taste and some recipes that are just to die for. This recipe can be used for cinnamon rolls, sticky rolls, sticky buns,or really anything you can think of. This is one of them. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1lb butter- melted\n* 4 cups whole milk (warm milk to reach temperatures between 105-110 degrees)\n* 2 tablespoons yeast\n* 2 tablespoons salt\n* 1 cup sugar\n* 6 eggs\n* 11 cups flour\n### Preparation\n\n* Preheat oven to 375 degrees (this is an “until done” recipe)\n* Bloom sugar, milk, and yeast until it foams. This takes a few minutes and you can start to smell the yeast. \n* Melt the butter and let it cool (let it cool till it is just warm not boiling)\n* Once the butter is cool and the yeast is foamy add all of the other ingredients in except the last 4 cups of the flour and mix thoroughly\n* Add in the flour reserve small amounts at a time\n* Mix on a low speed with a bread hook for 20-30 min (I( like to make it closer to 20 thean 30 just my opinion)\n* Remove bowl from the mixer and allow the dough to double in size on the counter\n* Punch down the risen dough and shape into its desired shape (if you are making cinnamon rolls this is the time to flatten the dough and roll it out with all of the ingredients and then make the roll shape), allow it to rise again\n"
