  "markdown": "### Summary\n\nNathan,\n\nThis is a heavier filling for deserts but it is so rich and savory that it cuts the sweet of all the other ingredients. Just something to balance. Just like in life not everything will be sweet, some things will be savory or salty but together they create complex and beautiful recipes. I know that sounds like some hippy stuff but some of those sayings are good because they are truthful. I love you dearly.\n\nMom\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* ½ cup heavy whipping cream; cold\n* ¼ cup powdered sugar\n* ½ cup + 1 tablespoon mascarpone at room temperature (drain for 10-15 min to remove any excess liquid for best results)\n* ½ teaspoon vanilla\n### Preparation\n\n* In a bowl beat the whipping cream and sugar until stiff peaks form\n* Beat mascarpone and vanilla until smooth\n* Combine both mixtures and whip until smooth (don’t over whip!!)\n",
