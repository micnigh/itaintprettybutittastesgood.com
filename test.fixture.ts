I thought a pie would be nice because the smell of a pie baking in the oven is too tasty to pass up. I love you dearly.\n\n\nMom\n\n#### Ingredients\n\n\n - 4 cups fresh cranberries or frozen\n - 1 orange (zest then juice) if you don’t want to juice it yourself then like a 1/2c oj\n - 1 ½ cups sugar\n - 1 tablespoon salt\n - 1 tablespoons flour\n - 1 packet gelatin (.25oz)\n - 1 store bought pie crust (1 top and one bottom, let's make this easy!)\n - 1 egg beaten to wash\n - 3 tablespoons sugar to top\n\n#### Preparation\n\n\n - Preheat oven to 325 degrees and \n - Place one pie crust in a 9\"or 10\" glass pie pan and set aside\n - Simmer on low cranberries, orange juice with or without the pulp, 1 ½ cups sugar, and salt on the stove top until the cranberries burst (if you use the frozen cranberries this will take a little longer but you still hear the \"popping\" sound when they burst and that is always fun)\n - Add flour and gelatin until the mixture thickens\n - Once thickened, pour the mixture into the pie pan and top with 1 teaspoon of the orange zest and then the second pie crust.\n - Make slits in the top of the pie crust so that it has some ventilation (if you want to be fancy you can cut designs in the top just use a cookie cutter to make it a little easier) and brush with the egg wash. When fully washed sprinkle on the 3 tablespoons of sugar (or add as much as you want at this point)\n - Bake in the over for 40-45 mins at 325 degrees \n`
